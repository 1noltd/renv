#' Virtual Environments for R
#'
#' Virtual environments for \R, inspired by the Python
#' [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and
#' [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) modules.
#'
#' By binding a project to a virtual environment, new \R sessions launched in
#' that project will use the set of \R libraries as defined within that virtual
#' environment. This allows projects to both isolate and share their \R package
#' dependencies, ensuring that updates to the packages used in one virtual
#' environment will not affect other virtual environments.
