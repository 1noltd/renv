## Why isn't my package being snapshotted into the lockfile?

By default, `renv` uses the intersection of:

1. Packages installed into your project library, and
2. Packages which appear to be used in your project (as discovered by
   `renv::dependencies()`),

in determining which packages should enter the lockfile. The intention is that
only the packages you truly require for your project should enter the lockfile;
development dependencies (e.g. `devtools`) normally should not. This kind of
snapshot is called a `"packrat"`-style snapshot, since the model here is similar
to the one used in the [Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) package.

If you'd instead prefer to capture _all_ packages installed into your project
library, you can instead use `"simple"` snapshots. Configure your project to
use `"simple"` snapshots with:

```
renv::settings$snapshot.type("simple")
```

Packages can also be explicitly ignored through a project setting, e.g. with:

```
renv::settings$ignored.packages("<package>")
```

You might want to double-check the set of ignored packages
(`renv::settings$ignored.packages()`) and confirm that you aren't
unintentionally ignoring a package you actually require.

See the documentation in `?snapshot` for more details.


## How should I handle development dependencies?

This is related to the above question: by design, `renv.lock` normally only
captures build-time or deploy-time dependencies; it may not capture the packages
that you use in iterative workflows (e.g. `devtools`). However, you may want
some way of still ensuring these development dependencies get installed when
trying to restore a project library.

For cases like these, we recommend tracking these packages in a project
DESCRIPTION file; typically, within the `Suggests:` field. Then, you can
execute:

```
renv::install()
```

to request that `renv` install the packages as described in the DESCRIPTION
file. In addition, the `Remotes:` fields will be parsed and used, to ensure
packages are installed from their declared remote source as appropriate.
