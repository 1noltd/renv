## Why isn't my package being snapshotted into the lockfile?

By default, `renv` uses the intersection of:

1. Packages installed into your project library, and
2. Packages which appear to be used in your project,

in determining which packages should enter the lockfile. The intention is that
only the packages you truly require for your project should enter the lockfile;
development dependencies (e.g. `devtools`) normally should not. This kind of
snapshot is called a `"packrat"`-style snapshot, since the model here is similar
to the one used in the [Packrat](https://rstudio.github.io/packrat/) package.

If you'd instead prefer to capture _all_ packages installed into your project
library, you can instead use `"simple"` snapshots. Configure your project to
use `"simple"` snapshots with:

```
renv::settings$snapshot.type("simple")
```

Packages can also be explicitly ignored through a project setting, e.g. with
`renv::settings$ignored.packages("<package>")`. You might want to double-check
the set of ignored packages (`renv::settings$ignored.packages()`) and confirm
that you aren't unintentionally ignoring a package you actually require.

See the documentation in `?snapshot` for more details.
