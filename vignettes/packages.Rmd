## Dependencies

Often, R packages will have other R packages as dependencies. For this, one must
declare their R package dependencies within the package `DESCRIPTION` file. If
you want to prepare your environment for package development, you can use:

```
renv::install()
```

to install the packages as declared in the package's `DESCRIPTION` file. This
action is roughly analogous to `remotes::install_deps()`.

If you're developing a package that you intend to release to CRAN, then you
likely want to build and test your package against the latest versions of your
dependencies as available on CRAN. For this, you should consider using:

```
renv::update()
```

to ensure your package dependencies are up-to-date, as appropriate.


## Isolation

Normally, a package under development should be tested against the
latest-available versions of its dependencies on CRAN. However, in some cases,
you may need to ensure your package is compatible with other packages also
currently under development.

In these cases, the `renv` project library can be useful -- you can install the
development version(s) of your dependencies into the project library, without
worrying about clobbering any packages already installed in your user library.

In these cases, you can declare your development dependencies using the
`Remotes` field of the `DESCRIPTION` file; e.g.

```
Remotes:
  r-lib/ggplot2
```

See the `remotes` vignette,
[Dependency resolution for R package development][dependencies],
for more details.
